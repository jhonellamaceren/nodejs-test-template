# Gitpod Workspace Configuration for Node.js

This template contains the Gitpod workspace configuration for Node.js with MySQL. Also, in this template, `npm` was already initialized and the following packages were already installed:
  - `express` - A web framework for Node.js
  - `mysql2` - A MySQL client for Node.js

A sample Node.js application was also included. To try it, run the `node app/app` command in the Terminal. The app starts a server and listens on port 4000 for connections.
